## Introduction

**Degen trading** is a style of trading in crypto where people take **very high risks** in hopes of making **very fast profits**. It is popular in Web3 because crypto markets move quickly, new tokens appear often, and prices can rise or fall sharply in a short time.

The goal of this explanation is to help you understand what degen trading really means, how it works, and why it is risky—without assuming you already know anything about crypto.

## Analysis of the Given Concept

At its core, **degen trading is not about careful planning**. It is about **speed, speculation, and risk**.

Here’s the logic step by step:

1. **Crypto prices can change very fast**
   Some coins can double, triple, or crash within hours. This creates opportunities—but also danger.

2. **Degens focus on these fast-moving opportunities**
   Instead of established coins, they often trade:

   * New tokens
   * Meme coins
   * Very small or unknown projects

3. **Decisions are often based on hype, not deep analysis**
   A degen trader might buy a coin because:

   * It is trending on X (Twitter)
   * Influencers are talking about it
   * Others are posting profit screenshots

   Research is usually shallow or rushed.

4. **The expectation is quick profit**
   Degens are not trying to hold for years.
   They hope for:

   * A quick price spike
   * Then a fast exit

5. **The risk is extremely high**
   Because many of these tokens:

   * Have no real product
   * Can be scams or “rug pulls”
   * Can lose value suddenly

   Losses can happen just as fast as gains.

A helpful analogy:
**Degen trading is like betting on a street football match instead of investing in a professional league.**
You might win quickly—but there are no guarantees, rules are weak, and the risk is on you.

## Given Concept in Relation to Its Field at Large

In the broader world of Web3 and crypto, degen trading sits on the **most aggressive end of the risk spectrum**.

* **Long-term investing** focuses on strong projects, slow growth, and safety.
* **Active trading** uses analysis, strategies, and risk control.
* **Degen trading** prioritizes speed and potential upside over safety.

Why it exists in Web3:

* Crypto is open to anyone
* New tokens launch daily
* Markets operate 24/7
* Information spreads instantly

This environment rewards bold moves—but also punishes mistakes harshly.

Importantly, **degen trading is not the same as understanding Web3 well**. Many experienced Web3 users avoid it or limit it to small amounts because they understand the risks.
